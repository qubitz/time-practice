Time Practice
=============
Time adding implementation with clean code practice and Python!

Wanted to practice some clean coding with some inspiration from [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) with my new Python skillzz. 

Each file offers a different implementation, each better than the last. The order goes:
* Time_expanded.py (most mundane)
* Time_shortended.py (functional)
* Time_OOP.py (uses abstraction! aka **best**)
